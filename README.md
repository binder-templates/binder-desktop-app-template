# Template for Linux Desktop Apps on Binder / JupyterHub

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yuvipanda/binder-desktop-app-template/HEAD?urlpath=desktop)

Generate a Git repository that can run any Linux GUI application in
the browser via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) or any JupyterHub
from this template repository!

Uses [jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy)
to work.

## How to use this repo

### 1. Create a new repo using this as a template

Use the [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
button on GitHub. Use a descriptive name representing the
GUI app you are running / demoing. You can then follow the rest of
the instructions in this README from your newly created repository.

### 2. Install the application you want

First the GUI application you want needs to be actually installed in
the image. There are three main ways to do this:

#### From `apt` via `apt.txt`

Many common Linux GUI applications are available to be installed from
the [Ubuntu Apt Repositories](https://packages.ubuntu.com). Adding their
name to `apt.txt` file is usually enough to get them installed. Note that
by default right now, the base image used by Binder and repo2docker is
using Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic, which can be a bit outdated.

#### From `conda` via `environment.yml`

A lot of scientific GUI applications are also packaged via [conda-forge]
and can be installed by editing the `environment.yml` file to include them.
For example, [qgis](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) is a popular
Geospatial GUI application, and is available on conda-forge. You can install
it by adding `qgis` under `dependencies` in `environment.yml`.

#### Manually, with a `postBuild` script

Sometimes the application you want is not available in apt or conda-forge,
or at least not the version you want. You've to manually install them
by writing a script in [`postBuild`](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#postbuild-run-code-after-installing-the-environment)
file to download the app manually (wia `wget` maybe) and extract the executable
application somewhere. You don't have `root` access here, so some of the things
you need to do might be limited. Consider writing your own `Dockerfile` instead.

### 3. Setup a desktop shortcut to your app

When the repo is launched on Binder / desktop is used on JupyterHub, a shortcut
that users can click to launch your app is pretty nice. This template contains
sample `app.desktop` file you can use to setup this shortcut. Our `start` script
will automatically make sure that any `.desktop` files (which is how most Linux
desktops indicate a shortcut file) are put on the user Desktop.

1. Rename the file from `app.desktop` to `<your-app-name>.desktop`
2. Open the file, and fill in values for `Name`, `Exec` and optionally `Icon`
3. Commit the file

### 4. Modify the Binder Badge in the README.md

The 'Launch on Binder' badge in this README points to the template repository.
You should modify it to point to your own repository. Keep the `urlpath=desktop`
parameter intact - that is what makes sure your repo will launch directly into
a Linux desktop.

### 5. Cleanup the README.md to document your application

Finally, cleanup your README.md to document the application in your repo! Users
of your repo want to see the application, not instructions on how to setup the repo :)

## Inspiration

Inspriation to make this particular template repository comes from conversation
